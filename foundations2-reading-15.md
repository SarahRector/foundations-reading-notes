* interesting that this article defines "on their way towards parity" as 37% of CS graduates being women in 1984.....

* also....the fact that in 2014 not a single "girl"(girl in quotation marks because I hate that women are referred to as girls even when they are adult humans) took an AP-level computer science exam in three whole states is horrifying

* marketing is awful and the gender binary is real messed up

* this article outlines a whole lot of the reasons why I don't have a degree in marine biology right now. Women, from the time we are in elementary school (and a lot of the times before that) are told that we just aren't as good at math or science and are funneled into arts and humanities instead of STEM fields

# Diversity in tech

* These are similarly horrific graphics

# Why diversity matters to your tech company

* this article mostly focuses on how diversity can increase productivity for your tech company. It was also written in 2015 and honestly I am a little surprised that given the moment in which we are living, this hasn't been updated. I feel like all of these articles focus on gender in tech and while that is absolutely important, we also need to be talking about race. This part of the curriculum should be updated.
