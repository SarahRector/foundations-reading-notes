    * each table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics
* three forms of normalization
    * these forms are progressive which means for 2 to happen, 1 already has to be satisfied, etc
    * **First Normal Form** the information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.

    * **Third Normal Form** the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
