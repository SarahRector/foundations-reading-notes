# How I explained REST to my brother
https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550

* very interesting article about REST and nouns and verbs in coding. This comment was a good summary: "From what I understand of this article polymorphism applies to REST by saying that we can have multiple nouns, ie things to be selected that have the same verb applied to them I.E. POST GET PUT DELETE. Which relate to SQL with INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE."
