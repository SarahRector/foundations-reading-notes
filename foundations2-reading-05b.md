# Problem Solving Skills
https://ryanstutorials.net/problem-solving-skills/

* be open minded
    * the problem may be diffferent than what you think
    * the cause might be different
    * starting over might be best
    * what you think could always be wrong

* be inquisitive
    * look for patterns
    * things that are odd or stand out
    * stuff that shouldn't be there
    * stuff might be missing

* ask the right questions
    * what is doing it and how is it being done?
    * how effective is it?
    * Why is it doing it and what would happen if it was missing
    * what's it's relationship to other components
    * how can I tes my own assumption?

* slow down
    * try saying it out loud to someone else, speech is a slower process than thought
    * leave it and come back later

* don't be lazy
    * start with the things that stand out and then go from there, piecing together the bigger picture

* don't panic (Sarah....)
    * "When you start looking at a problem and it seems really simple, you don’t really understand the complexity of the problem. Then you get into the problem, and you see that it’s really complicated, and you come up with all these convoluted solutions. That’s sort of the middle, and that’s where most people stop…

    But the really great person will keep on going and find the key, the underlying principle of the problem — and come up with an elegant, really beautiful solution that works."

    Steve Jobs

    * assess the situation - create a hypothesis - test your hypothesis

    * **A Game!** pick a normal object and try to come up with as many uses for it as you can - can play with your friends!

    * break the problem into as many smaller bits as possible

    * always try to come up with at least three ways to solve the problem

    * show someone else what's happening - they might have another idea or just explaining it to them can help
